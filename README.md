# React-Project

Please Note:
This project is still in development.
Also, I cancalled my subscription to Google Maps, so I dont have API key in my project,
you will get "somthing went wrong" when you try to see user location on map.

Right now im working on 2 bug fixes -> the first bug happens by pressing a user mail, 2 buttons get clicked, and the other bug fix is giving a permission access to the following URL - /user/:someusername
becuse right now its working only by pressing the user in the table ( I used useLocation and useNavigate )
