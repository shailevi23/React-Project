# React-Project-Moveo

Please Note: this project is still in development.
Also, i cancalled my subscription to Google maps so i dont have API key in my project.
you will get "somthing went wrong" when you try to see User location on map.

Right now im working on 2 bug fixes -> the first bug happens by pressing a user mail, 2 buttons get clicked, and the other bus fix is giving a permission access to the following URL - /user/:someusername
becuse right now its working only by pressing the user in the table ( becuase I use useLocation and useNavigate )
